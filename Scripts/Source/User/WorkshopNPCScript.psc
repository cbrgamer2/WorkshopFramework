	Kinggath Thoughts: The system of temporarily wounding the actor to not count their assigned objects ratings during combat seems rather pointless and wasteful. The combat will only last a few minutes and the assignments and corresponding values have no impact during that short a timespan. As soon as combat ends, the wound is removed.
	
	If the system was designed to leave people in a wounded state where they couldn't work for several days, this would make more sense.
	
	Leaving it for now to not break vanilla behavior, but will not be implementing this functionality for the nonWorkshopNPCScript actor support.
